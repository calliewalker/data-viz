### Course Description 
This course will train students to use cutting edge data visualization tools and software to make 
accurate and powerful graphs with public policy data. 
Students will learn about the fundamental concepts of graphing and visual perception such as to inform making charts 
and maps that are intuitive, effective, and memorable. 
The course will cover basic graphing skills in Excel, and quickly move on to making powerful data-driven graphics with R, 
aesthetic design using Adobe Illustrator, interactive web visualizations with GoogleCharts, and a range of other programs.
No prior programming or computer science skills are necessary. 

### Course Goals & Learning Objectives
My goal is to enhance your skills as a data driven policy analyst, who can:

1.	Ask interesting questions about American politics and public policy;
2.	Identify data that can be useful in answering those questions;
3.	Collect, clean, and document the data;
4.	Explore and analyze the data with basic statistical and graphical techniques, that is, perform exploratory data analysis;
5.	Create beautiful, compelling, informative and accurate graphics;
6.	Present these graphics to an educated audience.

### Directions for Students
Next Steps: Carefully review the remaining sections of the syllabus section of this course before beginning Week 1 activities, 
which are located in the Lessons folder in your online course.

Once you feel that you are ready to dive into the first week’s activities, 
click on the Lessons button on the left-side navigation menu. 
Then, click on Week 1 to begin with the Introduction and Objectives.

### What To Expect in this Course

This course is 12 weeks in length and includes individual, group, and whole group activities in a weekly cycle of instruction. 
Each week begins on a Monday and ends on the following Sunday. 
Please review the course syllabus thoroughly to learn about specific course outcomes and requirements.
For this course, there will be three synchronous events – or sync sessions. 
Attendance is highly recommended, but not mandatory. 
The link to the Adobe Connect room will be provided in the activity directions for this week. 
The recordings of each sync session will be placed on the Blackboard site afterwards. 

-	Week 1: Online session via Adobe Connect. Course Introduction & QA.
-	Week 6: Online session via Adobe Connect. Course Review & QA.
-	Week 10: Online session via Adobe Connect. Final Portfolio QA.

Each week, you will complete readings that may include videos, multimedia presentations, web-based resources, and published articles. 
Some of the readings may be integrated within an activity during the week or provide some key information to assist your learning. 
In this course, you will also experience online learning activities, which include synchronous sessions and the use of VoiceThread for discussions, feedback, and for final portfolio presentations.
Be sure to refer to the Checklist each week, which provides a week-at-a-glance and shows targeted dates for the completion of activities.

### Course Structure
The weekly topics that this course is divided into pertain predominantly to the material in the assigned readings. 
Many of the lectures are workshops focused on developing a specific technical skill (Excel, R, Illustrator, etc.). 
This means that although each week focuses on a specific type of data visualization (like time-series, or relationships), 
the material taught in the video sessions may at times be more generalized. 
This is a necessary dichotomy, since the course aims to both cover the theory and reasoning behind strong data visualization 
practices, and to offer a deep dive into cutting edge graphing skills.

### Assignment Guidelines
How should assignments be submitted?
Assignments should be submitted through Blackboard – 
due to the graphical nature of the assignments there is no need to use a plagiarism checking service. 
Please include your last name in the filename, followed by the assignment number: For example: Engler_Assignment1.pdf

When will assignments be due?
Assignments will be due at the end of each week, specifically Sunday night at midnight EST– 
each assignments will have a clearly stated due date and time on Blackboard.

When will completed assignments be returned?
The instructor will aim to return assignments to you within five days following the due date for most assignments. 
You will receive feedback under the My Grades link on the left-hand menu of your course. 
You are expected to try to incorporate feedback from the interim assignments (assignments 2 through 5) into the final portfolio.

What is the policy for late assignments?
You are expected to contact your instructor in advance if you think you cannot meet an assignment deadline. 
However, if an assignment is late and prior arrangements have not been made with the instructor, the assignment score will be docked by 5 percent for each day it is late.

What happens if I cannot participate in a synchronous session?
If you cannot attend a synchronous session, you will be responsible for watching the recording at a later time. 
There is no penalty for missing a synchronous session.

### Time Management Expectations
#### What is the time demand and schedule of the course?
Because this is a graduate-level course that is offered in a condensed format, 
the rigor and time commitment is higher than a traditional 15-week semester course. 
It is expected that you look ahead to schedule your time. 
Plan to complete coursework across several days of the week rather than all in one day.
The final portfolio requires that you work on it across the entire semester. 
Be sure to review the assignment directions at the beginning of the course so that you can plan your time accordingly. 
Please seek help before becoming frustrated and spending a significant amount of time to resolve an issue.


### Course Participation & Communication Policy

#### Participation
What are the participation requirements?
You are expected to log into the Blackboard at least (three) times a week, though a daily check-in is recommended. It is your responsibility to read all announcements and VoiceThread postings. 
You should revisit the weekly threads multiple times over the week to contribute to the dialogue. You are required to post responses to questions and topics posed by the instructor, and are encouraged to post additional threads commenting on interesting graphs (related to public policy or otherwise) that you encounter in media, from government agencies, through think tanks, or elsewhere. In addition to posing questions and discussion topics, the instructor will be available to answer questions and weigh in course topics via VoiceThread topics.

#### Network Etiquette (i.e. “Netiquette”)
In this course, online discussion will be primarily take place using Slack. 
In all online communication it’s important to follow proper rules of netiquette.

What is netiquette? 
Simply stated, it's network etiquette -- that is, the etiquette of cyberspace. 
And "etiquette" means the social and cultural norms of communicating with others in a proper and respectful way. 
In other words, netiquette is a set of rules for behaving and interacting properly online.

The Netiquette “Core Rules” linked below are a set of general guidelines for cyberspace behavior. 
They probably won't cover all situations, but they should give you some basic principles to use in communicating online.

For Netiquette Core Rules visit The Core Rules of Netiquette web page.
